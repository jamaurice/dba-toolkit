## 💡 Pro Tips from Production Experience

### 1. Start with Performance Reports
Run these weekly to establish baseline metrics. You'll quickly identify:
- Which queries need optimization
- Which indexes are unused
- Which tables need archiving
- Buffer pool/cache sizing issues

### 2. Automate Backup Verification
**Critical**: A backup you haven't restored is not a backup. Run verification weekly to catch:
- Corrupted backups
- Incomplete dumps
- Configuration issues
- Restore time problems (plan DR accordingly)

### 3. Monitor Replication Aggressively
Replication lag can cause:
- Data inconsistency between master and replica
- Failed read queries on stale replicas
- Application errors during failover

Check every 1-5 minutes and alert immediately when:
- IO/SQL threads stop
- Lag exceeds 10 seconds
- Replication errors occur

### 4. Health Checks Prevent Incidents
Hourly health checks catch issues before they become critical:
- Connection pool exhaustion
- Memory pressure
- Disk space depletion
- Buffer pool inefficiency
- Table bloat

### 5. Use Reports for Capacity Planning
Monthly review of performance reports helps predict:
- When to scale up instances
- When to add storage
- When to implement read replicas
- When to archive old data

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Credential Management
```bash
# Use environment variables (never hardcode passwords)
export MYSQL_PASS="password"

# Or use MySQL config file
cat > ~/.my.cnf << 'EOF'
[client]
user=dba_user
password=your_password
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.my.cnf

# Or PostgreSQL password file
cat > ~/.pgpass << 'EOF'
hostname:5432:database:username:password
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.pgpass
```

### Log File Security
```bash
# Restrict log file permissions
chmod 640 /var/log/dba/*.log
chown root:dba /var/log/dba/*.log

# Rotate logs to prevent disk space issues
# Add to /etc/logrotate.d/dba
/var/log/dba/*.log {
    weekly
    rotate 4
    compress
    delaycompress
    missingok
    notifempty
}
```
